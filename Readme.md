# CodeDesignPlus.Resources.DesployBase

This repository contains the resources and deployment files that support the articles of [**Phase 2: Deploying the CodeDesignPlus Ecosystem**](https://www.codedesignplus.com/blog/ecosistema/1-microservices-and-process/). Here you will find the values, commands, and configurations needed to deploy the microservices and resources described in the blog.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 24**
- The base infrastructure from **Phase 1** must be ready, following this guide: [Infrastructure Roadmap](https://www.codedesignplus.com/blog/env-dev/2-hoja-ruta/)

## Initial Setup

Before running the deployment script, you must create a `values.json` file in the root of the project, using the structure of `values.example.json` as a reference. This will allow you to avoid interactive prompts. If any value is missing in `values.json`, the script will prompt you for it during execution.

## Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a microservice or resource and contains:

- `values-*.yaml` files for Helm values.
- A `commands.md` file with recommended deployment and management commands.

## Automated Deployment

The main file is `main.mjs`, which scans the `index.mjs` files of each microservice. Each one initializes the deployment, runs the Helm charts, configures secrets in Vault, and prints the result of each operation to the console.

### How to Run

To start the deployment, run:

```powershell
npm start
```

If your `values.json` file is complete, the process will be automatic. If any value is missing, you will be prompted for it in the console.

### Example Output

```powershell
PS E:\Repositories\CodeDesignPlus.Resources.DesployBase> npm start

> codedesignplus.resources.desploybase@1.0.0 start
> node ./main.mjs
